-> Performance Optimized: Implements industry-standard techniques for a blazing-fast user experience:

-> Shimmer UI: Provides a better loading experience instead of a blank screen.

-> Lazy Loading & Code Splitting: Bundles code into smaller chunks, loading them only when needed to reduce initial load time.

-> State Management with Redux: Centralized state management for a scalable and maintainable application architecture.

-> Modern React: Built using functional components and the latest React Hooks for efficient and readable code.
